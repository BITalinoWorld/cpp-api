  The %BITalino C++ API (available at http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/cpp-api) is a cross-platform library which enables C++ applications to communicate
  with a %BITalino device through a simple interface.
  The API is composed of a header file (bitalino.h)
  and an implementation file ([bitalino.cpp](http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/cpp-api/tree/master/bitalino.cpp)).
  A sample test application in C++ ([test.cpp](http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/cpp-api/tree/master/test.cpp)) is also provided.
  
  There are three ways to connect to a %BITalino device:
  - direct Bluetooth connection using the device Bluetooth MAC address (Windows and Linux);
  - indirect Bluetooth connection using a virtual serial port (all platforms);
  - wired UART connection using a serial port (all platforms).
  
  The API exposes a single class (BITalino). Each instance of this class represents a connection
  to a %BITalino device. The connection is established in the constructor and released in the destructor,
  thus following the RAII paradigm. An application can create several instances (to distinct devices).
  The library is thread-safe between distinct instances. Each instance can be a local variable
  (as in the sample application) or it can be allocated on the heap (using new and delete operators).
  
  \section sampleapp About the sample application
  
  The sample application ([test.cpp](http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/cpp-api/tree/master/test.cpp)) creates an instance to a %BITalino device.
  Then it starts acquiring all channels on the device at 1000 Hz and enters a loop while dumping
  one frame out of 100 and toggling the device green LED. Pressing the Enter key exits the loop,
  destroys the instance and closes the application.
  
  One of the provided constructor calls must be used to connect to the device.
  The string passed to the constructor can be a Bluetooth MAC address (you must change the one provided)
  or a serial port. The serial port string format depends on the platform.
  
  In order to have a more compact and readable code, the sample test code uses C++11 vector initializer lists.
  This new C++ feature is supported only in Visual Studio 2013 or later (on Windows), GCC 4.4 or later and Clang 3.1
  or later. If you are using an older compiler, use the commented alternative code for the `start()` and
  `trigger()` methods calls.
  
  \section windows Compiling on Windows
  
  The API was tested in Windows 7 (32-bit and 64-bit).
  
  To compile the library and the sample application:
  - create a C++ Empty Project in Visual Studio;
  - copy [bitalino.cpp](http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/cpp-api/tree/master/bitalino.cpp),
  [bitalino.h](http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/cpp-api/tree/master/bitalino.h) and
  [test.cpp](http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/cpp-api/tree/master/test.cpp) to the project directory;
  - add bitalino.cpp and test.cpp files to the project at the “Source Files” folder;
  - edit test.cpp as described \ref sampleapp "above";
  - add a reference to `ws2_32.lib` in Project Properties → Configuration Properties → Linker → Input → Additional Dependencies;
  - build the solution and run the application.
  
  \section linux Compiling on Linux

  The API was tested in Ubuntu (32-bit and 64-bit) and Raspberry Pi (Raspbian).
  
  To compile the library and the sample application:
  - `make` and `g++` must be installed;
  - packages `bluez`, `libbluetooth3` and `libbluetooth-dev` must be installed if you want to
    compile the library with Bluetooth functionality (to search for Bluetooth devices and
    to make direct Bluetooth connections);
  - copy [bitalino.cpp](http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/cpp-api/tree/master/bitalino.cpp),
  [bitalino.h](http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/cpp-api/tree/master/bitalino.h),
  [test.cpp](http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/cpp-api/tree/master/test.cpp) and
  [Makefile](http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/cpp-api/tree/master/Makefile) into a new directory;
  - if you want to compile the library without Bluetooth functionality, disable the line in
    Makefile where `LINUX_BT` is defined;
  - if your compiler doesn't support vector initializer lists, remove the flag `-std=c++0x`
    from the test.cpp compiling rule in Makefile;
  - edit test.cpp as described \ref sampleapp "above";
  - enter command `make` in the command line to build the library and the application;
  - enter command `./test` in the command line to run the application.
  
  \section macosx Compiling on Mac OS X
  
  The API was tested in Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.9.
  
  On Mac OS X, the %BITalino API Bluetooth functionality is not available, so it is only possible
  to connect to a %BITalino device through a serial port for indirect Bluetooth connections or for wired UART connections.
  
  To compile the library and the sample application:
  - copy [bitalino.cpp](http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/cpp-api/tree/master/bitalino.cpp),
  [bitalino.h](http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/cpp-api/tree/master/bitalino.h),
  [test.cpp](http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/cpp-api/tree/master/test.cpp) and
  [Makefile](http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/cpp-api/tree/master/Makefile) into a new directory;
  - if your compiler doesn't support vector initializer lists, remove the flag `-std=c++0x` from
    the test.cpp compiling rule in Makefile;
  - edit test.cpp as described \ref sampleapp "above";
  - enter command `make` in the command line to build the library and the application;
  - enter command `./test` in the command line to run the application.
